# Lab 1: Car Price Prediction


## Overview
This project involves web scraping car listings to gather valuable data for predicting car prices. The primary goal is to practice working with asynchronous requests using `aiohttp`, parsing data from the web, and performing initial data preparation for a baseline model.

## Objectives
- **Web Scraping:** Scrape a website to extract useful information on car listings.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Utilize `aiohttp` to make non-blocking, asynchronous web requests.
- **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the data for further analysis.
- **Baseline Model:** Develop a simple model to predict car prices based on the scraped data.
